            <h3>Book Summary</h3>
            <p>Set in a dystopian future where totalitarian rule has eliminated privacy and individual thought, "1984" follows Winston Smith, a low-ranking member of 'the Party' in London. In this world, Big Brother watches everything, the Thought Police patrol citizens' minds, and history is constantly rewritten. Winston begins to question the Party's control and falls in love with Julia, leading him down a dangerous path of rebellion against the oppressive regime. Orwell's masterpiece explores themes of surveillance, truth, and the power of authoritarian governments.</p>

                    <p>It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.</p>
                    
                    <p>The hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features.</p>
                    
                    <p>Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week.</p>

                    <p>A tremor had gone through his bowels. To dissemble his feelings, to control his face, to do what everybody else was doing, was an instinctive reaction. But there was a space of a couple of seconds during which the expression of his eyes might conceivably have betrayed him.</p>
                    
                    <p>And it was exactly at this moment that the significant thing happened—if, indeed, it did happen.</p>
                    
                    <p>Momentarily he caught O'Brien's eye. O'Brien had stood up. He had taken off his spectacles and was in the act of resettling them on his nose with his characteristic gesture.</p>

                    <p>Winston woke up with the word 'Shakespeare' on his lips. The telescreen was giving forth an ear-splitting whistle which continued on the same note for thirty seconds. It was nought seven fifteen, getting-up time for office workers.</p>
                    
                    <p>Winston wrenched his body out of bed—naked, for a member of the Outer Party received only 3,000 clothing coupons annually, and a suit of pyjamas was 600—and seized a dingy singlet and a pair of shorts that were lying across a chair.</p>
