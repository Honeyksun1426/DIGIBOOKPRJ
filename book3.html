            <h3>Book Summary</h3>
            <p>Set in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930s, this powerful novel is narrated by Scout Finch, a young girl whose father, Atticus Finch, is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of rape. The story explores themes of racial injustice, moral growth, and the loss of innocence through Scout's eyes. As she and her brother Jem witness their father's courageous stand against prejudice, they learn valuable lessons about empathy, justice, and human dignity. Harper Lee's masterpiece remains one of the most important American novels addressing racism and social inequality.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
                    <p>When I was almost six and Jem was nearly ten, our summertime boundaries (within calling distance of Calpurnia) were Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose's house two doors to the north of us, and the Radley Place three doors to the south.</p>
                    
                    <p>We never put back into the tree what we took out of it: we had given him nothing, and it made me sad.</p>
                    
                    <p>Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the courthouse sagged in the square.</p>

                    <p>September came and with it school; second grade was as bad as first, only worse—they still flashed cards at you and wouldn't let you read or write.</p>
                    
                    <p>Miss Caroline Fisher was no more than twenty-one. She had bright auburn hair, pink cheeks, and wore crimson fingernail polish. She also wore high-heeled pumps and a red-and-white-striped dress.</p>

                    <p>Catching Walter Cunningham in the schoolyard gave me some pleasure, but when I was rubbing his nose in the dirt Jem came by and told me to stop.</p>
                    
                    <p>"You're bigger'n he is," he said.</p>
                    
                    <p>"He's as old as you, nearly," I said. "He made me start off on the wrong foot."</p>
