                    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
                    <p>The story begins in the peaceful Shire, where the hobbit Frodo Baggins inherits a mysterious ring from his uncle Bilbo. It is soon revealed to be the One Ring, a powerful artifact created by the dark lord Sauron to control Middle-earth. The wizard Gandalf urges Frodo to leave the Shire to keep the Ring safe.

Frodo sets out with his friends — Sam, Merry, and Pippin — and eventually joins forces with Aragorn (a ranger with royal lineage), Legolas (an elf), Gimli (a dwarf), Boromir (a man from Gondor), and Gandalf. Together, they form the Fellowship of the Ring, tasked with the mission to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged.

                    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
                    <p>The Fellowship is broken. Frodo and Sam head for Mordor alone, but are followed by Gollum, the Ring's former owner, who becomes their guide — both helpful and treacherous.

Meanwhile, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli pursue the orcs who have kidnapped Merry and Pippin. The hobbits escape and encounter Treebeard, an Ent (tree shepherd), and help inspire the Ents to attack Isengard, where the corrupted wizard Saruman has been building an army.

Aragorn’s path takes him into the kingdom of Rohan, where the people are under threat from Saruman. With the help of Gandalf (who returns as Gandalf the White), they rally the Rohirrim and win a great battle at Helm’s Deep.

The war for Middle-earth begins to rage as the shadow of Mordor grows. The heroes must unite the Free Peoples and prepare for the final confrontation.

                    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
                    <p>The final battle looms. Frodo and Sam, led by Gollum, trek deeper into Mordor, facing betrayal, exhaustion, and the pull of the Ring. Gollum eventually leads Frodo into a trap — the lair of the giant spider Shelob. Frodo is poisoned, but Sam rescues him and continues to carry both Frodo and the Ring forward.

Aragorn claims his place as king of Gondor, leading the united forces of Rohan and Gondor against Sauron’s armies. In a last stand at the Black Gate, the heroes create a diversion to help Frodo reach Mount Doom.

At the edge of the fiery chasm, Frodo is overtaken by the Ring’s power and refuses to destroy it. But Gollum, in a desperate struggle, bites off Frodo’s finger to reclaim the Ring — and falls into the fire, destroying both himself and the Ring.

With the Ring gone, Sauron is defeated, his armies collapse, and peace begins to return. Aragorn is crowned king. Frodo, deeply scarred by his journey, eventually sails west to the Undying Lands with Gandalf, Bilbo, and the Elves, seeking peace and healing beyond the mortal world.
