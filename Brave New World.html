                    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
                    <p>We are introduced to the futuristic society of the World State, a highly controlled and technologically advanced world. Natural birth is obsolete; people are artificially created and conditioned in Hatcheries. Each person is assigned a caste (Alpha to Epsilon), determining their intelligence, job, and social status. Stability, community, and consumption are valued above all. Emotions, individuality, and critical thinking are suppressed through genetic manipulation and psychological programming. Everyone is taught to be happy with their role. Soma, a feel-good drug, keeps people docile and content.

We meet Bernard Marx, an Alpha who feels out of place. He’s shorter than others of his caste and secretly hates the artificial nature of the world. Meanwhile, Lenina Crowne, a Beta, follows the norms but becomes curious about Bernard, who invites her to a Savage Reservation—a place where people still live naturally, without the influence of the World State

                    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
                    <p>On the Savage Reservation, Bernard and Lenina meet John, also known as the Savage. He is the son of two World State citizens, but was born and raised among the "savages" with old books like Shakespeare as his guides to life and morality. His mother, Linda, had been stranded there years ago and became a social outcast.

John is fascinated by the World State and agrees to return with Bernard to London. Back in the modern world, John becomes a sensation—"the Savage" is a celebrity. But he quickly becomes disillusioned. He is disgusted by the shallow pleasures, casual sex, lack of emotional depth, and absence of genuine human connection. Bernard basks in the fame he gets by association with John, while Lenina becomes infatuated with John, though he finds her superficial and overly conditioned.

                    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
                    <p>John’s inner conflict grows. He wants real love, meaning, and suffering—all of which the World State has erased. He argues with Mustapha Mond, one of the World Controllers, who defends the system: people must trade freedom and truth for comfort and order. In this society, art, religion, and philosophy are sacrificed to preserve stability.

John cannot reconcile with this world. After Linda dies of a soma overdose and the masses remain emotionally indifferent, John flees into the wilderness, seeking purity. But society follows him. He becomes a spectacle again, and unable to escape the artificiality of the modern world, John ultimately takes his own life—his final rejection of the dystopia.
