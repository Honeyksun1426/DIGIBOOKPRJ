                    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
                    <p> Jane hides behind a curtain with a book, The History of British Birds. Her cousin John Reed discovers her, insults her, and throws the book at her. </p>
                    <p>When Jane retaliates, she is blamed for the altercation and punished by being locked in the "red-room," the chamber where her uncle died. </p>
                    <p> Overwhelmed by fear and the oppressive atmosphere, Jane believes she sees her uncle's ghost and faints. </p>

                    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
                    <p>Jane regains consciousness and finds herself still confined in the red-room. She pleads to be released, but her cries are dismissed by the servants, Bessie and Miss Abbot, who accuse her of being ungrateful. Jane's intense fear and emotional turmoil highlight her feelings of isolation and injustice</p>
                    <p>This chapter introduces themes of supernatural elements and the struggle against oppression.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
                    <p>After fainting, Jane wakes up in the nursery under the care of the kind apothecary, Mr. Lloyd, and the servant Bessie. Mr. Lloyd listens to Jane's account of her mistreatment and suggests to Mrs. Reed that Jane be sent away to school. Jane is cautiously optimistic about this prospect. Later, Jane overhears Bessie and Miss Abbot discussing her background, learning that her mother was disowned by her wealthy family for marrying a poor clergyman, and that both her parents died of typhus. </p>
                    <p>This revelation deepens Jane's understanding of her social standing and the reasons behind her aunt's disdain.
