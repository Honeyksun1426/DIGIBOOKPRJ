                    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
                    <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</p>
                    
                    <p>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.</p>
                    
                    <p>"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"</p>
                    
                    <p>Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.</p>
                    
                    <p>"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it."</p>
                    
                    <p>Mr. Bennet made no answer.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Do you not want to know who has taken it?" cried his wife impatiently.</p>
                    
                    <p>"You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."</p>
                    
                    <p>This was invitation enough.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week."</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
                    <p>Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it.</p>
                    
                    <p>It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with:</p>
                    
                    <p>"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."</p>
                    
                    <p>"We are not in a way to know what Mr. Bingley likes," said her mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."</p>
                    
                    <p>"But you forget, mamma," said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him."</p>
                    
                    <p>"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion of her."</p>
                    
                    <p>"No more have I," said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you."</p>
                    
                    <p>Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain herself, began scolding one of her daughters.</p>

                <section id="chapter3" class="chapter">
                    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
                    <p>Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.</p>
                    
                    <p>They attacked him in various ways—with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas.</p>
                    
                    <p>Her report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with him. He was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party.</p>
                    
                    <p>Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.</p>
                    
                    <p>"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield," said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, "and all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."</p>
