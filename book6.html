                    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
                    <p>People think money decisions are based on logic and math, but they're actually emotional and deeply personal.

Your background, experiences, and upbringing shape how you view money (saving, spending, investing).

Two people can look at the same financial event and react completely differently based on their life stories.

Key lesson: Be aware of your biases — your behavior with money often matters more than your knowledge.

                    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
                    <p>Wealth is built slowly over time—not by luck or intelligence alone, but by consistency and long-term thinking.

Saving is more important than income: people with modest salaries can become wealthy if they save well.

Compounding is a superpower: small amounts grow into large sums if you give them enough time (like Warren Buffett, who got rich by staying invested for decades).

Key lesson: Focus on time in the market, not timing the market.

                    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
                    <p>Many people confuse looking rich with being rich.

Fancy cars, watches, or homes are visible, but actual wealth is often invisible — it's the money not spent, the savings and investments.

Financial independence (freedom and control over your time) is the ultimate goal, not showing off.

Key lesson: Don’t fall for lifestyle inflation — the ability to live below your means creates lasting wealth.
