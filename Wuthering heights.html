                    <p>Years earlier, Mr. Earnshaw brought home an orphan boy named Heathcliff, who grew close to his daughter Catherine.

Catherine and Heathcliff had a wild, passionate bond, but she ended up marrying Edgar Linton, a wealthy neighbor, because of status and comfort.

                    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
                    <p>Catherine dies after giving birth to Cathy, Edgar’s daughter.

Heathcliff grows even more bitter, raising his own son Linton Heathcliff in a cruel way.

Eventually, young Cathy is forced to marry Linton, giving Heathcliff legal control over Thrushcross Grange.

After years of pain and conflict, Heathcliff becomes haunted by Catherine’s ghost, longing to be reunited with her.

Heathcliff dies, seemingly at peace, and is buried beside Catherine.

The story ends with young Cathy and Hareton Earnshaw (Heathcliff’s enemy’s son) falling in love, offering hope and healing for the future
