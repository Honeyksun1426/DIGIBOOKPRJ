            <h3>Book Summary</h3>
            <p>Set in the fictional town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930s, this powerful novel is narrated by Scout Finch, a young girl whose father, Atticus Finch, is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of rape. The story explores themes of racial injustice, moral growth, and the loss of innocence through Scout's eyes. As she and her brother Jem witness their father's courageous stand against prejudice, they learn valuable lessons about empathy, justice, and human dignity. Harper Lee's masterpiece remains one of the most important American novels addressing racism and social inequality.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
                    <p>The novel begins with Nick Carraway, the narrator, introducing himself and explaining his background.</p>
                    
                    <p>He's from the Midwest and has moved to West Egg, Long Island, to work in the bond business. His neighbor is the mysterious and wealthy Jay Gatsby, who lives in a grand mansion and throws lavish parties..</p>
                    
                    <p>Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the courthouse sagged in the square.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
                    <p>This chapter shifts to the "valley of ashes", a bleak industrial area between West Egg and New York City. Nick travels with Tom into the city, and on the way, they stop to pick up Myrtle Wilson, Tom's mistress, who lives in the valley with her husband George Wilson, a poor mechanic..</p>
                    
                    <p>They go to a party in a New York apartment Tom keeps for Myrtle. The gathering becomes rowdy and unpleasant, showcasing the vulgarity and carelessness of Tom's circle. Myrtle becomes increasingly drunk and loud, and when she taunts Tom about Daisy, he violently hits her, breaking her nose. Nick, disturbed by the scene, leaves the party disillusioned.</p>

                    <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
                    <p>Nick finally receives an invitation to one of Gatsby’s famous parties—a rare privilege, as most guests simply show up uninvited. At the party, Nick is struck by the extravagance and the strange mix of people. He runs into Jordan Baker again, and the two explore the party together..</p>
                    
                    
                    <p>Eventually, Nick meets Jay Gatsby himself, who turns out to be surprisingly young, polite, and reserved—very unlike the rumors swirling about him. Gatsby and Nick bond over shared military service in World War I. Jordan later tells Nick that Gatsby has a secret and a plan related to Daisy. The chapter ends with Nick describing his developing feelings for Jordan, though he finds her to be dishonest, and notes that he is beginning to get more involved in the world around him.
